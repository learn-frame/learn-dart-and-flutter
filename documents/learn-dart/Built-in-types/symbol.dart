/// Symbol
///
/// A Symbol object represents an operator or identifier declared in a
/// Dart program. You might never need to use symbols, but theyâ€™re invaluable
/// for APIs that refer to identifiers by name, because minification changes
/// identifier names but not identifier symbols.

void main() {
